Online Food Waste Donation System

Complete Project Explanation for BCA Final Year

🟦 1. Why This Project Is Needed? (Problem Statement)

Every day, thousands of restaurants, hotels, canteens, events, and marriage halls waste a huge amount of fresh, edible food because:

They cook extra food

People don’t eat the full portion

Food gets left after events

There is no proper system to donate it quickly

At the same time, many people in the city:

Sleep hungry

Don’t get a single meal

NGOs try to feed poor people but don’t know where food is available

👉 Main Problem:
There is no platform that connects food donors (hotels, restaurants) with NGOs instantly.

🟩 2. How This Project is Useful in Real Life?
