Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is an open-source cross-platform runtime environment that allows you to use JavaScript to develop server-side applications.

Every web browser has a JavaScript engine that compiles JavaScript code to machine code. For example, Firefox uses SpiderMonkey, and Google Chrome uses V8.

computer can understand only muchine language so that the engine( V8 , etc) was convert js script to machine code (00110).

=========

Node.js is single-threaded

meaning each process runs only one thread of execution.

The single-threaded execution model allows Node.js to handle more concurrent requests easily via the event loop. As a result, Node.js applications typically consume less memory compared to others.


==>   that means the all loop & Functions are run in one thread , if any loop and Functions need time then other function was not stop they run in background and executed ..

synchronous : if any function and loop take time then other function are not execute they wait .

Asynchronous : in this one opposit to synchronous if any fuction and loop take time then other function/Statement not wait they execute in background .

=============

🚀 What is a Node.js Module?

A Node.js module is a small, independent piece of code that can be used (imported) in other files.

👉 In simple words:
Module = A file that contains reusable code.


in that case node module and react component are not same because the node module has work in backend for a fuction / loop ,, in other side the react component was use to rerender the ui .

========         Node.js provides 3 major types of modules:
